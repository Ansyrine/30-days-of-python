This is my journey into learning Python 3+ 

I have a lot of passion heading into this project, and I hope I can show it more as the days add up. 
Currently on day 5 I have nothing but confidence, a lot of questions, and a will to learn, that I don't see stopping any time soon. 
Using this I will complete the 30 days, then try create a couple projects to really cement what I learned in this challenge I have chosen to undertale
